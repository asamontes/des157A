            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <p>- I will be updating my Studio 3, Game On project. Due to unforeseen circumstances I did not have a lot of time to work on this project and had to quickly come up with an idea. Since I am able to choose one project to expand on for the final, I want to go with my Studio 3. I like the graphics I made for this project and I can expand on the main idea of the project so that it is more game like.</p>

            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>- I mentioned above that the main idea of the project can use some fixing. By broadening my idea, the project will seem more game like. The project currently lacks a lot of features that allows for a user to experience my website. So to make it more interactive I want to add more features that allow for the user to respond to questions that lead them to one outcome. There will be multiple outcomes depending on what a user responds/chooses through out the ‘journey’ of the game. I think the design of the game is fine, I think it’s nice that it’s plain and simple. I will have to tweak it so that I can add more features for the addition of interactive buttons and more questions and overlays but it is doable. I will most likely focus on usability so I can make the page more interactive and lengthy. </p>

            <h2>Expert Feedback</h2>
            <p>I might want to ask one of my other design professors as well as one of the teachers assistants in class. While I do want to focus on usability, I also want to make sure that everything else looks and works fine.</p>
