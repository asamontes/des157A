            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The project I am choosing to expand on is my GameOn! Studio 3 project. Version one of this project includes two overlays and a couple of graphics to create a small and short little activity where you can ask Silly the squid to tell you your fortune. Based on the number you get from “rolling” dice, you are given a fortune.</p>
            <p>Testing the usability of my project today, I found that the project feels incomplete to users. While the theme of the project is enjoyable visually, it lacks activity. Users have commented that the project would be better if it were more interactive. The users that tested my current project today were Serena and Benay. Both users fit my demographic of young adults who enjoy both art/design and games. I asked both of my users to follow three simple tasks; explore the website, search for more interactive buttons, and to try and interact with the entire page. I basically just had them do what they wanted to while also wanting to have them try anything out even though I knew there were only two ways of interacting with the website.</p>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Some bugs that I noticed between the two user tests is that the audio sometimes sounds scuffed depending on the user's browser or laptop. I also noticed that the background music sometimes does not play which might have to do with the browser the user uses. Usability wise both Serena and Benay were able to click the two available buttons but due to the different window sizes and the lack of responsive design of my page, at times some of the buttons would disappear and other times the graphics would move.</p>
            <p>When Serena tested the project, they did not know what to do after getting their fortune. They questioned if it was all they needed to do before returning to the main page. I reiterated that I just wanted them to keep exploring so they went on to try and see if they could roll every number available and see each possible fortune. When Benay tested the project, she enjoyed the small and short activity of “rolling” the dice and finding out every fortune.</p>
            <p>I asked both users post-test questions regarding the website’s design and its usability. Serena was very vocal about how much they loved the theme of the project and the visual aspects like the glowing font, the halftone brush, and the animated button. They stated that the website was cohesive although still mentioning that it could be improved. Even though they said that the website visually looked like a game, Serena felt that the website felt more like a quick gift than a game. They compared it to the fortune cookies that some restaurants give you after your meal. I asked Serena how the website could be expanded and they gave me a wide set of ideas. They suggested adding more questions for users to respond to or to give users choices to make in order to gain a reward. Serena said they’d enjoy the website more if it had more ways for them to interact with it and be rewarded for their work. They added that with more interactions and options, they would very likely repeat the game to find out more about the different responses, prizes/rewards, and outcomes. Lastly, they gave some more simple feedback on the visual aspect of the game stating that the addition of more graphics in the open spaces of the main page would be favorable.</p>
            <p>Benay was also vocal about her likeness of the graphics and visual design of the website. She recognized the character as the squid that sits on Levi’s cat tree. Despite enjoying the color scheme and aesthetic of the page, Benay also did not think the website was game-like. She mentioned that based on her own understanding of game characteristics that my project was lacking mostly in interaction and activity. She favored the simplistic look and feel of the “game” and mentioned that even with very little to do, it was still a great idea for a project. Benay stated that the addition of questions and/or options to the website would make it more interactive and while she enjoys how simple the available interaction is now and how easy the usability is, she thinks the website would benefit from the addition of more actions and decisions that the user can make.</p>
