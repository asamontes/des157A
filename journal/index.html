                <p>The topic of the article is very important, especially for designers who have not created forms in the past. Every person has experienced filling out a form online but there are certain problems that most people face when filling out online forms. One thing I never thought about or even thought about considering in the design of a form is the width of input fields. I usually already know the size of each information I input especially if it is constant like your address and zip code. I like that the article mentioned accesibility because it is important to not leave out the disabled community who sometimes use technology as a way to communicate. The article is very helpful for me to learn about form design and prepare myself for future projects and work where I will be responsible with creating forms for users. </p>

                <p>For school, I have mostly only used Google Forms to create and fill out digital/online forms. Depending on who creates the forms, they can be very thought out and well built so the user can easily fill out the form. Google Forms gives you the control to add more ways to respond and different types of questions like multiple choice or short answer. Sometimes forms can exemplify best practices but not always. Here's an example of a <a href="https://forms.gle/pwSgbPD3mpxfonPb6">Google Form</a>, that doesnt really exemplfy much but the form is good enough.</p>
