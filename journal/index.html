            <h2>Best practices for form design</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>January 24, 2024 | Journal 1</h3>
                <p>The topic of the article is very important, especially for designers who have not created forms in the past. Every person has experienced filling out a form online but there are certain problems that most people face when filling out online forms. One thing I never thought about or even thought about considering in the design of a form is the width of input fields. I usually already know the size of each information I input especially if it is constant like your address and zip code. I like that the article mentioned accesibility because it is important to not leave out the disabled community who sometimes use technology as a way to communicate. The article is very helpful for me to learn about form design and prepare myself for future projects and work where I will be responsible with creating forms for users. </p>

                <p>For school, I have mostly only used Google Forms to create and fill out digital/online forms. Depending on who creates the forms, they can be very thought out and well built so the user can easily fill out the form. Google Forms gives you the control to add more ways to respond and different types of questions like multiple choice or short answer. Sometimes forms can exemplify best practices but not always. Here's an example of a <a href="https://forms.gle/pwSgbPD3mpxfonPb6">Google Form</a>, that doesnt really exemplfy much but the form is good enough.</p>

            <h2>Best Practices for Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>January 30, 2024 | Journal 2</h3>
                <p>The article is very helpful in reminding designers on what they should and shouldn't do when adding modals to their websites. I had never known what these modals were called until now because I usually identified them as popup windows. I think it is fasinating to understand and learn the "behind the scenes" of how something like modals are created and how designers learning UI/UX can implement these patterns or characteristics into their own work. I think it was very helpful for the author to mention that we should not surprise the user with a modal but rather have the user trigger the appearance of a modal. I also appreciate the addition of notes about accessibility and how to make modals accessible as well as giving a source for us designers to make sure our work is accessible and user friendly.</p>

            <h2>10 intriguing photographs to teach close reading and visual thinking skills</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>February 6, 2024 | Journal 3</h3>
                <p>I think I was taught about visual thinking skills in highschool or maybe even in middle school and I just don't remember due to my lack of memory. I think visual thinking skills is very important to have for academics and to use outside of school and during your own life. I would say its just like observing your surroundings and being aware of what is happening around you. I agree with a lot of what the article says because using what we find and see in photographs helps with finding more details in everything we interact with. Somethings might be missed on but you can always go back again and again to see what else you can find through a photograph, an article, a book, and anything else. I have definitely become a lot better at understanding readings and photographs after getting used to closely observing things and finding every little detail that might be to small to notice if you move to quickly.</p>

                <p>I looked at the <a href="https://www.les-arbres-fruitiers.fr/#content">Les Arbres Fruitiers</a> website. Its about product designs and shows a series of products through a overlay transition (I think) and a vertical slide show that first appears in a graphic of a leaf that is the website's logo. It is a very impressive website and I really enjoy their graphics, color scheme, and transitions/transformations.</p>

            <h2>Visual Thinking Analysis</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>February 15, 2024 | Journal 4</h3>
                <p>I am very excited for all my images. I have many perfect photographs of my cat Levi and there is a ton of emotion and memories in all of them. However, one image of him is very dear to me. In this particular photo he is curled up asleep on a couch that is foreign to him underneath a brand new Snoopy blanket. There's an orange and red hue that you can see in the photo and it colors him warmly. You wouldnt know about his anxious body movements while sleeping in a new living room, in a new apartment. You can't tell that he's stressed and scared. You can't even begin to understand how much weight his behavior had on me for weeks. To me it's interesting because it holds fresh nostalgic memories from a few months ago and also because he's surrounded by soft textures and a few of my favorite colors. This image is related to my topic because I want the user to see and read Levi's experience in his new home through a series of photos. It doesn't tell a story about me but about my cat. I could care less if people new about me but Levi is a king on a throne. He is a historic artifact and telling people about him is my duty (not really but I love him).</p>

                <p>One of my classmates had talked about her idea of making a website where the user can look at her doodles she has done on reciepts of places she's been to or places she has worked at. She didn't have any photographs on hand but I could imagine detailed sketches of parking structures and buildings based off her descriptions. Having this theme, she is able to use her drawings to maybe showcase how a place used to look like before a renovation or to display a distant memory from when she was friends or family. I think if some of these drawings are places that people can't recognize then it'll be a mystery to the user. However I think that sense of mystery adds more character to the project.

            <h2>Game Design UX Best Practices</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>February 26, 2024 | Journal 5</h3>
                <p>I have always been super intrigued by game design because of how much I love videogames. I never looked into this particular subcategory of design because I felt that I might like it a bit too much compared to other career paths that would probably benefit me a bit more. This article was more focused on video game applications on mobiles. I enjoy a few mobile games and a lot of what the author talked about are actually a few things I hate about them. It was interesting to learn about some of the other reasons why they choose to design mobile games the way they do. The information on pop ups mostly made me think of ads that sometimes pop up while you're playing mobile games, however, the author was more specifically talking about pop ups like a paused screen. I have never realized that the coding languages I am learning at this moment are also used for some of my favorite video games (mobile games included). I think the most frustrating thing about mobile games is that a lot of the UI positions and decisions are for marketing as well a profit. So in my mind I wouldn't find it enjoyable to work with mobile games.</p>
